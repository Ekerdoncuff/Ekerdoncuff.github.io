I am a postdoc with [Priya Moorjani](https://moorjanilab.org) at University of California, Berkeley, USA.

My research area is population genetics, both theoretical and applied. I like to develop and apply methods for inferring population history.

Currently I am currently working on South Asian population evolutionary history and on developing local ancestry inference methods. Using data from ~2,700 whole genome sequences, we have reconstructed 50,000 years of evolutionary history of India: [preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.15.580575), [podcast](https://youtu.be/TjfY0K4RMVQ?feature=shared).

Before that I completed my PhD (2021) in Population Genetics from the Sorbonne University where I worked with [Guillaume Achaz](https://smile.cnrs.fr/people.php?titre=Guillaume-Achaz) and [Amaury Lambert](https://smile.cnrs.fr/people/amaury/) at [Atelier de BioInformatique](https://bioinfo.mnhn.fr/abi/presentation.FR.html) at the Natural History Museum and the [SMILE team](https://smile.cnrs.fr/index.php) at College de France, Paris, France.
During my Ph.D, I developed methods to infer the recent demography of human populations leveraging polymorphisms and genetic linkage data.
My PhD manuscript can be found [here](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-03681808/document) and the oral presentation [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfHKV86zDL8) (in french).
