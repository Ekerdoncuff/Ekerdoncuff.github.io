I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Human Evolutionary Genetics team](https://research.pasteur.fr/en/team/human-evolutionary-genetics/) at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, France, working with Lluis Quintana-Murci and Etienne Patin. My current work focuses on tracing ancestral genomes from genome-wide genealogies to gain insights into human genetic history in the Pacific.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher with [Priya Moorjani](https://moorjanilab.org) at the University of California, Berkeley, USA. My research focused on population genetics, both theoretical and applied. I developed and applied methods to infer population history.
During this time, I worked on the evolutionary history of South Asian populations and on developing local ancestry inference methods. Using data from approximately 2,700 whole genome sequences, we reconstructed 50,000 years of evolutionary history of India: [preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.15.580575), [podcast](https://youtu.be/TjfY0K4RMVQ?feature=shared)

Before that I completed my PhD (2021) in Population Genetics from the Sorbonne University where I worked with [Guillaume Achaz](https://smile.cnrs.fr/people.php?titre=Guillaume-Achaz) and [Amaury Lambert](https://smile.cnrs.fr/people/amaury/) at [Atelier de BioInformatique](https://bioinfo.mnhn.fr/abi/presentation.FR.html) at the Natural History Museum and the [SMILE team](https://smile.cnrs.fr/index.php) at College de France, Paris, France.
During my Ph.D, I developed methods to infer the recent demography of human populations leveraging polymorphisms and genetic linkage data.
